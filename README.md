# Data-ANZ-Program
This my solution for Task 1 of the [Data@ANZ Virtual Experience Program](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/ZLJCsrpkHo9pZBJNY/Data@ANZ%20Program?ref=84MJ7eMKSJrshwqGw) on Forage

This task is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 monthsâ€™ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions.

I analysed this dataset and drew some vitualizations to find actionable insights of transactions and customer behaviors. 

The process of data analysis is as follows:

* 1. Basic check: to have an overview on the dataset and find its issues, any missing values, does it need to be cleaned ?
* 2. Exploratory data analysis: Split data into 2 types: Categorical variables and Numeric variables to analyse with statistical metod. 
* 3. Data Wragling : Drop unwanted columns, deal with missing values and create some additional features for deeper analysis.
* 4. Deeper Analysis: Segment the dataset by transaction date and time (month, day, hour), by category.
